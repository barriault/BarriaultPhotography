		I was Hacked. I am careless. I know nothing about web security. I should have maintained my servers well. And Next Time I won't use GoDaddy. They Suck. This is my punishment.

		By Your Hacker - I have access to all your domains. All your email ids, heroku account, git account and what not. I intend no harm. I won't tell you how I was able to crack open your digital life. But let's just say your google account's security is weak and very easy to break. Plus I was inspired by Mr. Robot :P.

		<ul>
			<li>Free Tip 1 : Never Use Phone Number in Google Security and make that phone number public on your website</li>
			<li>Free Tip 2 : Always Use 2 factor Authentication on Google :P</li>
			<li>Free Tip 3 : For god sake you recovery email address on google was same as your contact address on website. Are you kidding ??. It took me seconds to figure out</li>
			<li>Free Tip 4 : Do not connect all your account to your email acoount. It becomes a single point of failure :P </li>
			<li>I meant no harm. I haven't read any of your emails. I haven't misused your account accept for this. I did this to teach you a lesson. I even have you credit card details, but then I don't want money. I am just an undergrad student. I am learning and I was bored :P</li>
			<li>If you wish to know me, leave me a message on your website. BTW you can re-gain access to your account by using google's account recovery tools :P</li>
